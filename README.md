# Multinomial Processing Tree Model of Source Monitoring
### 2018 Computational Modeling @SNU

#### Term Project

Through latent-trait approach of multinomial processing tree, this project presents a hierarchical
model that estimates detecting and guessing probabilities in source monitoring task. First,
whether the process of remembering the information(item memory) and the process of
remembering in which context the information was received(source memory) work separately is
tested. While a traditional unidimensional memory model assumes that a single mental
representation covers both item and source memory, alternantive two-dimensional accounts
suggest two independent systems. According to the results of model comparsion, there exists no
significant difference between those two models based on this experiment. Second, probability-
matching theory is tested. The obtained parameter estimates show positive correlation between
contingency judgments and source guessing probabilities and negative correlation between
deviation of contingency judgements from true contingency and source detecting probabilities.
The result strongly supports the idea that people make guesses based on their own perceived
contingeies between item and source when they do not remember the source.
